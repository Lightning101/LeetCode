# LeetCode Practice
An hour of LeetCode a day keeps the CS lecturers away

# Ideal outlines
These are my ideal timings and complexities for problem specifications

## Timing
Timings for levels of problems

**Easy**: 0-5min
**Medium**: 0-15min
Breakdown:

 - 0-5min - For question comprehension.
 - 0-10min- For solution 

**Hard**: 0-inf min
Breakdown:

 - 0-5min - For question comprehension.
 - 0-inf- If God blesses me that day

## Complexity
Given a input specification an acceptable solution complexity can be deduced.

### Input Range
 **0- 10^4**: log(n), nlog(n), n, n^2
  **0- 10^8**: log(n), nlog(n), n
  **n>10^8**: log(n), nlog(n)
